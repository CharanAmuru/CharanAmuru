## Hi, I’m Charan Sai Amuru 👋

Backend engineer focused on building systems that are reliable,
clear, and meant to last.

I work mostly with .NET and ASP.NET Core, designing APIs and backend
logic where correctness, clean structure, and long-term maintainability
matter more than quick demos.

### What I focus on
- Backend & API development
- ASP.NET Core, C#, SQL Server
- Data consistency & stateful systems
- Clean architecture & system design
- Cloud deployments on Azure

### Featured Work
A few projects that reflect how I approach real backend systems:

- **Trading Platform**  
  Backend-first trading system handling order lifecycle, background
  execution, and position management.

- **AutoUML Generator**  
  AI-powered tool that converts source code into UML diagrams and keeps
  them in sync with Git commits.

- **Smart Patient Health Monitoring System**  
  Secure, role-based healthcare application deployed on Azure.

I enjoy working on problems where clarity, correctness,
and long-term thinking matter.
